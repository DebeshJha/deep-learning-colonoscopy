## Edit the *Data Augmentation Strategies* tables

The *Data Augmentation Strategies* has many columns and the second row must be updated with the number of studies using each type of data augmentation, thus the following procedure is recommended:

1. Copy the table code from the README.md file into a plain text file (e.g. *data-augmentation-table.csv*).
2. Open this plain text file with a spreadsheet software like LibreOffice Calc.
3. Edit the table in the spreadsheet software, remenbering to to increase the number of studies using each type of data augmentation.
4. Save the edited table into CSV using '|' as separator character.
5. Copy the code from the edited table into the README.md file.
